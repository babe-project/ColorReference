Demo of interactive experiments with \_babe.

WIP. The recording of experiment results and advancing to the next round of the experiment have not been implemented yet.

To run the demo:

- Clone the repo
-   `npm install`
-   Open `test.html` in your browser
-   Open `test.html` in another browser tab
-   Now one tab should be assigned the speaker role and another the listener role
